When i was using flask i didn't find any UI tool that can help me manage Mysql with easy UI like Adminer provides in PHP.
I was a PHP developer for a long time and now when i started working as Python developer, 
i guess it would be good opportunity to learn and expore Python by developing something that can help me and others as well.
Also PyAdminer give me good understanding of Mysql basic structure and management.

With a very busy schedule of job, it's really deficult to work on this project full time, however i like to put my 1-2 hours everyday.
but it will be big help if you can give me a hand on it. also suggestions are welcome to improve the project in a user friendly way.
